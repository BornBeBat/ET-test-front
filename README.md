## Introduction

Hello, you are in the repository for my test task, here is a description how it works.

## Description
- **Events board page**: When the application is first loaded, the user is taken to an event list page. events can be sorted using a drop-down list "Sort" opens after click. At the page added infinite scroll pagination activated when the last loaded element comes into view port.
- **Event registration page**: After clicking on the "Register", the application goes to the event registration page. The registration form consists of three inputs and one group of radio buttons; all fields have minimal validation. After successful registration, the user is redirected to the event participants page.
- **Event participants page**: You can get to this page in two ways: first, click “View” while on the Events board page, or successfully register for the event. It is possible to search for event participants by name or email. 

## P.S.
Back-end is deployment on <a href="https://render.com/" target="blank">Render</a> so you have to wait a little before it wakes up and starts responding to requests.<br/>
